## Debugging Instructions

This section provides guidelines on how to debug your application effectively using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and the integrated debugger. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Official VSCode Debugging Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

### Debugging the `ai_agents_streaming_flow` Agent

To debug the `ai_agents_streaming_flow` agent, start by identifying the issue you're facing. Set breakpoints in your code, particularly at the beginning of the main function and before key function calls. Launch the debugger in Visual Studio Code and use **Step Over** (F10) to navigate through the code, or **Step Into** (F11) to delve into functions. As you step through, inspect variable values by hovering over them and monitor the call stack to understand the flow of execution. Check for common issues like incorrect parameter values or logic errors. After making adjustments based on your findings, test the application again to ensure the issue is resolved.
